# Internship

The result of my internship at the State Statistics Service of Ukraine is a report that describes the state institute in general and contains an individual calculation and analytical work "Analysis of primary data on the amount of air pollutant emissions for 2020" using PyCharm software, the Python programming language and its libraries (OpenPyXL, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn).

The report file is available in Ukrainian in the repo.

It is also planned to compile the entire code into a separate .py file with all the necessary comments in English.
